## Introduction

<p>This field is divided in three categories, which is <b>Complexity Theory</b>, <b>Computability Theory</b>,  <b>Automata theory</b>.<br> </p>

<p> <b><i>Complexity theory:</i></b> determine which "complexity" can a problem (which it'll be the solution or the algo) be "allocated" to. So to categorize which problems are more computionally harder than others. We don't know the answer to that but it has been researched for 40 years, but researcher have discovered an elegant scheme to classify problems according to their computational difficulty.</p>

<p><b><i>Computability Theory:</i></b> To determine which problem are solvable and which are not. One of the examples of a problem not solvable is the problem of wheter a mathematical statement is true or false (no general algorithm to determine if a mathematical statement is true or false, also Godel theorem). Among the conseguence of the result was the development ideas concerning theoretical models of computers that eventually would help lead to the construction of actual computers.</p>

<p><b><i>Automata Theory:</i></b> it deals with the definitions and
properties of mathematical models of computation. they play a significant role
in many areas of computer science.<br>
<i>finite automaton:</i> is used in text processing, compiler and hardware design.<br>
<i>Context free grammar:</i> is used in programming languages and AI.</p>

> so the basic difference from Complexity Theory and Computability is that one is concentrated on how hard is it to compute the other IF it's computable.

## Basic Matematical notion and Terminology

<p>A set is a group of objects represented by as a unit. They can contain any type of object, the object in a set are called elements or members.</p>

<p>this is one way of representing them:</p>

$ S = \{1, 2, 3\} $ 

<p> the symbol $ \in $ denotes a membership of an object in a set, $ \notin $ denotes a non-membership.
ex: $ 3 \in S$.<p>

<p>to say a set is a subset of another it means that a set has all the elements inside of another. let's say we have $A = \{3,4,5\}$ and $ B = \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$, we can say that A is a subset of B because 3,4,5 are also elements of B and it's gonna be written as $A \subset B$ and if every elements of B is equal to A and viceversa the symbol which we're gonna use it's  " $ \subseteq $ ".</p>

<p>the order of the object in a set doesn't matter, also you can repeat members. If we do want to take the number of occurrences of members (repeated obj) into account, we call the group a multiset instead of a set, giving $ \{7\} \neq \{7,7\}$. </p>

<p>to describe that a set goes to infinity we use the "$...$" , an example: $\{1,2,3,...\}$.</p>
